# EdgeTX Field Notes Script

A Lua script for EdgeTX radios (tested on Radiomaster Boxer) to quickly log field notes such as:
- Pack number & condition
- Prop type & condition
- Flight notes

Logs are saved to `/LOGS/fieldnotes.txt` on your radio's SD card.

## Installation
1. Place `fieldnotes.lua` in `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/` on your SD card.
2. Run it from `SYS â†’ Tools` menu.
